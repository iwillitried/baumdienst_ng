        "0": "I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Zip. That easy. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death.\n\nWe'll put a happy little bush here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Let's make a happy little mountain now.\n\nMaybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.\n\nI'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You gotta think like a tree. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.\n\nThat's crazy. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky?\n\nThe very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Just let these leaves jump off the brush There we go. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.\n\nThis painting comes right out of your heart. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here.\n\n",
        "1": "So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Do an almighty painting with us. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Use your imagination, let it go. Let's have a happy little tree in here.\n\nEverything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.\n\nYou want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Play with the angles. Trees grow however makes them happy.\n\nIf you hypnotize it, it will go away. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let your heart be your guide. This is the way you take out your flustrations. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death.\n\nLet's go up in here, and start having some fun It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Brown is such a nice color. Fluff that up. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that.\n\nWorking it up and down, back and forth. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend.\n\nWe'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. In your world you have total and absolute power. See there how easy that is.\n\n",
        "2": "There comes a nice little fluffer. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. We need dark in order to show light.\n\nWe don't have anything but happy trees here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. See there, told you that would be easy.\n\nJust use the old one inch brush. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.\n\nThis is gonna be a happy little seascape. That easy. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We'll play with clouds today.\n\nA fan brush can be your best friend. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.\n\nThe least little bit can do so much. It's all a game of angles. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Let your imagination be your guide. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Just relax and let it flow. That easy.\n\nNow, we're going to fluff this cloud. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Here's another little happy bush This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.\n\n"
